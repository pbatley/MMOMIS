    "description": "Space is essential for activities to function5 for example, shipping requires room fortransit and anchorage and fishing requires access to grounds. Some activitiesoperate in the same space, such as recreational activities in a marine protectedarea (depending on the management measures). Others require exclusive use ofan area, for example, for reasons of navigational safety. Co-existence is wheremultiple developments, activities or uses exist alongside or close to each other inthe same area or at the same time6. This is different to co-location where multipledevelopments, activities or uses share the same spatial footprint or marine area ona longer term basis.",
    "reason": "Space within the south marine plan areas is limited. The Marine Policy Statement7encourages compatibility, encouraging co-existence between different activitieswithin the context of social, economic and environmental considerations. Activitiesthat can co-exist should be encouraged to do so, for example, fisheries andtourism or aquaculture and wind farm developments.\nWhere co-existence is not possible, the potential use of a site over differentperiods of time should be explored. For example, early negotiation with aggregateextractors prior to the construction of oil and gas infrastructure. Where co-existenceor sequential use of a site cannot be achieved, other measures to minimise ormitigate impact should be explored.\nThis policy is required to make sure that proposals seek to minimise the footprint oftheir development considering co-existence with other activities, where appropriate.Other policies under this objective, manage the spatial requirements of specificsectors.",
    "implementation": "Proposals will:\n- demonstrate whether and how the footprint could be reduced to minimiseuse of space\n- consider opportunities for co-existence with existing activities or otherknown planned proposals (for example aquaculture development inan offshore windfarm)8\n- consider impacts upon existing activities in the proposal area.

For example, static installations could change mobilesediments to solid substrate resulting in a change in habitat with possible impacton other activities such as recreational sea angling.\nAs well as the need to manage spatial interactions with other marine users, thereis also the need to manage interactions with heritage sites (objective 8 – heritageassets), marine protected areas (objective 10 – marine protected areas) and otherinterests. Examples of how this is being achieved include the aggregates industrywhich has already adopted a range of best practice measures. This includes developing guidance notes concerning heritage, reporting protocols, and fisheriesliaison codes of practice. In addition, regional approaches to assessment,monitoring and management have been adopted through regional dredging associations and associated marine aggregate regional environmentalassessments.",

Rigs are used to drill for hydrocarbons, and production is either via aplatform or floating storage facility, where it may be processed prior to beingexported ashore via pipelines or using shuttle tankers.",
    "reason": "Oil and gas provides the UK with a significant proportion of its primary energydemand, contributing 70% in 20159.\nMaximising the recovery (and transmission) of oil and gas sustainably, where it iseconomic to do so, is a priority for energy supply and security  as stated ingovernment’s statutory Strategic Security of Supply Reports of 2010 and 2011 andthe Oil and Gas Authority’s Maximising Economic Recovery Strategy for the UK(MER UK). These state that oil and gas are crucial to meeting UK energy needsduring the transition to a low carbon economy.\nWhilst no offshore oil and gas production currently takes place within the southmarine plan areas, there are existing licensed blocks within the south inshore planarea (see figure 4). Further licences may also be issued by the Oil and GasAuthority in future licensing rounds. Oil and gas licensed blocks should besafeguarded for the activities identified in the licence until the licence issurrendered, (including completion of any relevant decommissioning activity),unless agreement over co-located use can be negotiated or suitable mitigationsuch as temporal measures are agreed. More detail on how such issues may beresolved between offshore wind and oil and gas is provided by the writtenministerial statement made by the Secretary of State for Energy and ClimateChange to Parliament on the 12th July 2011 and the subsequent guidance: Oiland Gas Clause in Crown Estate Leases guidance on procedures for independentvaluation where necessary.\nThis policy gives clarity on dealing with potential future conflicts with other userswho may want to use the same space. It builds upon Marine Policy Statement(3.3.4 and 3.3.8) which states: ‘The UK’s policy objective to maximise economicdevelopment of the UK’s oil and gas resources’ and ‘maximising the economicrecovery of UK oil and gas resource sustainably is therefore a priority in the UK’s energy supply and energy security strategies’.",

Both require substantial investment and satisfactory agreement betweenthe relevant competing sectors where any conflict remains. The policy wordingsupports that approach.\nThe Oil and Gas Authority, which was set up in April 2015 and is now responsiblefor issuing Seaward Production and Exploration Licences and the Department forBusiness, Energy and Industrial Strategy Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning, which is responsible for issuing activity specific approvals, should be consulted when considering whether a proposal hasa potential impact on current or future exploration and production of oil and gas.\nFuture oil and gas proposals may require access to the same area of seabed asother proposals. Proposals located in or around a licensed block should demonstrate they can co-locate with any oil and gas activities (see figure 4). Due tothe small footprint of oil and gas infrastructure any actual conflict or impact may beminimal.\nEarly engagement is recommended with the oil or gas licence holder especiallywhere a Seaward Production licence exists, as there may be requirement fornegotiation between parties involved, the Oil and Gas Authority and theDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

    "reason": "Tidal energy development is limited by the natural features needed to create tidalcurrents sufficient to drive tidal stream devices. Consequently tidal energy can onlybe harvested in a limited number of areas in English waters. Proposals are typicallyconstrained to sites around headlands and channels around the coastline. Theseareas require protection from other new developments and activities which couldimpact upon the generating capacity of a tidal energy device. Considerable tidalresource exists within the south marine plan areas.\n67.The need to protect tidal energy resources is recognised in the Marine PolicyStatement (3.3.21) stating ‘it is important for marine planning to take account ofappropriate locations for such [tidal and wave energy] developments alongsidemore established uses of marine space’. This is reinforced in the National PolicyStatement for Energy EN-1 (3.3.10) stating ‘As part of the UK’s need to diversifyand decarbonise electricity generation, government is committed to increasingdramatically the amount of renewable generation capacity. In the short to mediumterm, much of this new capacity is likely to be from onshore and offshore windenergy projects, but increasingly it may include plants powered by the combustionof biomass, waste, or the generation of electricity from wave or tidal power.’\n68.This policy protects locations both inside and outside areas identified for tidal energydevelopments from other activities or developments, that could impact upon the abilityto realise energy generation from tidal stream devices.

This is particularly important in the south marine plan areas where fisheries for high value, low volume catches have resulted in a greater proportion of smaller vessels than the national average. Predicted increases in unsettled weather under climate change scenarios represent an operational challenge for smaller vessels while restricted ranges limit the ability of a fleet from a particular port to track stock distribution changes.\nThe Marine Policy Statement (2.3.1.1) directs marine planning to be ‘based on anecosystem approach’ to achieve high level marine objectives such as to ’maximise sustainable activity, prosperity and opportunities for all, now and in the future’. The need for planning to consider future use therefore necessitates regard to diversification, climate change projections and future climate scenarios.Diversification opportunities are also linked to objective 2 – infrastructure, inrelation to infrastructure provision, objective 4 – skills and employment, particularlywhere diversification includes non-fishing activities, objective 1 – co-existence and objective 5 – displacement. These are important in allowing fishing fleets to change where and when they fish in response to changes in fish distributions.",

Preventing the risks involved, and dealing with impacts when they occur, requires significant resources. A range ofmeasures are in place to achieve successful management in the face of coastalchange. Marine plans play an important part in this, including ensuring decisions inthe marine area avoid exacerbating detrimental coastal change and do not compromise, and preferably complement, existing measures.\nThis policy recognises changes to the coastline (for example managed realignment) can be beneficial for flood risk management, communities and biodiversity. It does not therefore look to restrain coastal defence or flood risk management proposals that will stabilise, reinforce or purposefully alter the coastline with the express aim of reducing vulnerability to coastal change.\nThis policy will complement other measures to manage coastal change and also support the need for resilience and adaptation along the coastline of the southinshore plan area to benefit all users, in line with the Marine Policy Statement(2.6.7 and 2.6.8) and the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment Report.Adaptation measures are covered explicitly through policy S-CC-2.

Theclassification of ecosystem services adopted by the Millenni um EcosystemAssessment categorises services as follows: provisioning, regulating, cultural andsupporting services. Flood defence and carbon sequestration services (theprocess of capturing carbon dioxide from the environment) are regulating services.\nHabitats such as saltmarshes, sand dunes, seagrass beds and mudflats, provide avariety of ecosystem services. Saltmarshes and mudflats play an important naturalrole in protecting the coast from flood events, by reducing wave energy andbuffering flood waters. Well-developed sand dune systems act to stabilisesediments, therefore reducing coastal erosion.\nIn addition, the above habitats also provide a natural carbon sequestration service.Salt marsh habitat is one of the most productive ecosystems in the world and assuch can sequester a large amount of carbon. Importantly due to the anoxic (withoutoxygen) nature of this habitat, the carbon is often shifted from the short term to thelong term carbon cycle.

Water quality in respectof the Water Framework Directive is defined by specific biological, physico-chemical and hydromorphological criteria. The objectives of the Water FrameworkDirective to protect and improve water quality set ambitious environmental goalsand actions which are implemented by River Basin Management Plans. Thesepolicies seek to complement these objectives and River Basin Management Plan implementation.\nPoor water quality as a result of multiple activities is an issue within someestuaries, with impacts on several sectors, such as aquaculture, fishing, tourismand recreation. Sensitive receptors within coastal and estuarine water bodiesare good indicators of change when assessing water quality. For example,microscopic plants in the water column and an increase in opportunistic seaweedspecies can be a sign of nutrient enrichment.\nHabitats and species including coastal saltmarshes, intertidal mudflats, seagrassbeds, reed beds and natural blue mussel beds benefit water quality by providingecosystem services. Ecosystem services can be defined as ’the benefits providedby ecosystems that contribute to making human life both possible and worthliving’. Ecosystem services fall into one of four subcategories depending on theircontributions: provisioning, regulatory, cultural or supporting services. NaturalEngland Commissioned paper 088 identifies the types of habitats and speciesassemblages that can be of benefit to water quality by providing regulatoryecosystem services such as water filtration, nutrient assimilation or hazardouschemical sequestration (see also policy S-CC-4):\n- water filtration is the physical process of removing contaminants from water flowing through a system\n- nutrient assimilation is the result of actions to enhance and accelerate theability of the ambient environment to accept nutrients (phosphorus andnitrogen) and still meet water quality standards\n- hazardous chemical sequestration is the capture and long-term storageof chemicals that might degrade water quality standards in line withreporting for the Water Framework Directive objectives\nCoastal saltmarsh habitats, reed beds and intertidal mudflats aid in reducingturbidity and sedimentation and in the longer term can remove through isolationhazardous chemicals and nutrients. Seagrass beds play a role in the removal ofnitrogen and can reduce turbidity. There is also evidence that seagrasses areeffective in the removal of hazardous chemicals from the water column. Filterfeeding shellfish, such as blue mussels, filter water and absorb nutrients(particularly nitrogen) from the water column thereby improving water quality.",

This is reflected in both the SouthEast and South West River Basin Management Plans. The expected increase inthe number and diversity of marine users within the south marine plan areas posesadditional risk in meeting Good Ecological status in accordance with the WaterFramework Directive. Activities and developments can place additional stress onwater resources through:\n- increasing demand for freshwater\n- increasing the volume of discharge\n- through physical modification of the water column and movement\nThe South Marine Plan builds on existing measures, consistent with the MarinePolicy Statement (2.5.13) and addresses water quality issues through ensuringproposals and public authorities consider impacts on water quality, including habitat and species assemblages that provide water filtration, nutrient assimilation and hazardous chemical sequestration services, and look for opportunities to improve water quality. The plan policies are not restricted to the inshore marine plan area as there is the potential for offshore sources to affect inshore water quality.",

The current status of water bodies is set out in the 2015 River Basin Management Plans.\nPolicies S-WQ-1 and S-WQ-2 align with the Marine Policy Statement (2.6.1.4). They complement actions of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (S1, 5 and 8) and the Water Framework Directive. Application of the Water Framework Directive is enacted through River Basin Management Plans and the catchment based approach through Catchment Partnerships, as well as current water company controls and regulations. Other regulations should be taken into consideration, when appropriate, such as Nitrate Vulnerable Zones.\nPublic authorities should consider water quality when authorising land-based infrastructure. Examples of land-based infrastructure that should be considered include land-based handling and disposal facilities for refuse, waste water and sewage to support recreational, residential and commercial boating and shipping activities. See also S-INF-1 under objective 2.\nProposals may be required to undertake a Water Framework Directive Assessment as part of obtaining regulatory consent for their activity. Being exempt from the need to undertake an assessment does not exempt proposals from policy S-WQ-1 or S-WQ-2.\nSimilarly, although a Water Framework Directive Assessment can contribute to demonstrating compliance with these policies, there may be impacts outside of the requirements of Water Framework Directive Assessment that still need to be addressed to demonstrate compliance with policies S-WQ-1 and S-WQ-2.\n Proposals should consider the Environment Agency’s Clearing the Waters for All guidance and the Marine Management Organisation’s Environmental Remediation to Improve Water Quality report in their application of policy S-WQ-1 and when considering the need for a Water Framework Directive Assessment. The Environment Agency advocate using the catchment data explorer to identify which water body your activity is in and any linked water bodies it could affect.\nProposals and activities, such as recreation, not covered by the Clearing the Waters for All guidance have the potential to adversely impact water quality.

The ability ofhabitats and species to adapt to change is important for biodiversity both within andoutside of statutory designations.\nConnectivity between species, habitats and populations (both within and outside ofthe south marine plan areas) is important for maintaining genetic diversity andallowing species to undergo seasonal breeding and foraging migrations. Habitatfragmentation and loss as a result of development often has a negative impactsuch as on population numbers or on the movement of individuals betweenincreasingly isolated populations. This threatens species long term viability.\nHabitat and species connectivity is particularly relevant for the south marine planareas, where competition for space and increased levels of development along with the predicted effects of climate change (see also objective 7 – climate change)is likely to lead to habitat fragmentation.\nEnsuring the connectivity of habitats and species within and outside of the south marine plan areas is also important as it contributes to the maintenance and cohesion of the existing marine protected area network (see objective 10 – marine protected areas).\nPolicies S-BIO-1 and S-BIO-2 will also aid the achievement of Good Environmental Status for Descriptor 1 of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive141 (see also objective 11 – Marine Strategy Framework Directive and Water Framework Directive) and contribute to the UK’s high level marine objectives for living within environmental limits\nHow the policies will be implemented\nPolicies S-BIO-1 and S-BIO-2 are locally and spatially specific. See the Marine Information System for the location or distribution of broadscale habitats, and of some habitats and species that are protected or of conservation concern. The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act (S41), requires the Secretary of State to publish a list of habitats and species of principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity in England. The S41 list should be used to prioritise habitats and species.\n It is important to note that where evidence is not available there may still be features that are sensitive or of conservation concern. Proposals may require additional and more specific evidence.\n It is essential to identify the location of features and sites within the south marine plan areas that are important for enabling habitats and species to adapt, connect and migrate as well as those important for wider biodiversity, including beyond marine protected areas.\nWhere new evidence emerges that improves or changes the evidence provided here, this must be used in applying these policies.

This will enable public authorities to make an informed assessment as to whether or not the proposal meets the policies. Evidence to demonstrate consideration could be drawn from sources including the South Marine Plan and its technical annex, the South Plans Analytical Report and the Marine Information System.\nExamples of important habitats and species are detailed in paragraph 672.

    "reason": "The South Plans Analytical Report identified a lack of space for coastal habitatsas a specific problem in the south inshore area. This is due to coastal squeeze,a process where habitats have decreasing space between rigid coastalstructures and rising sea level or coastal erosion. Coastal squeeze occurs dueto development, industrial expansion and provision of hard sea defences and is already affecting habitats such as saltmarsh. Sea level rise as a result of climate change will add to this pressure particularly along the coast and within estuaries (see also objective 7 – climate change).\nMaintaining the extent and distribution of coastal habitats (S-BIO-3) and priorityhabitats (S-BIO-4) is important as it reduces habitat fragmentation, speciesisolation and ensures the maintenance of biodiversity.

However, not all coastalhabitats occur within designated sites or are subject to statutory protection.\nThe Marine Policy Statement states that marine plans will contribute to theachievement of the UK’s high level marine objectives, which includes thefollowing: ‘Healthy marine and coastal habitats occur across their natural rangeand are able to support strong, biodiverse biological communities and thefunctioning of healthy, resilient and adaptable marine ecosystems’.\nAchieving these policies will also aid in achievement of Good EnvironmentalStatus for Descriptor 1 of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive by ensuring that the extent of habitats that are important for the maintenance ofbiodiversity are not reduced (see also text under objective 11 – Marine StrategyFramework Directive and Water Framework Directive) and contribute to theUK’s high level marine objectives for living within environmental limits.",

The Marine Management Organisation has identified herring spawning areas located within figure 26 and therefore this policy applies to proposals located within this figure.\nThe following two examples highlight how existing proposals may mitigate any potential impacts to herring spawning areas within ranked areas shown in figure 26.\nMarine dredging proposals (green, yellow, orange and red refer to those coloursas indicated on figure 26):\n·green – low herring spawning potential – no herring spawning mitigationrequired\n·yellow and orange – low to medium and medium to high potential –spatial, temporal and extraction intensity mitigation should beconsidered during peak herring spawning period (1 December to 31January)\n·red – high herring spawning potential –\nono extraction in the peak spawning period from the 1 Decemberto 31 January annually\nospatial, temporal and extraction intensity mitigation should beconsidered during 1 November to 30 November and 1 February –last day of February annually\nPiling proposals: green – low herring spawning potential. No herring spawningmitigation required if it is demonstrated that there will be no noise impacts frompilling activity in the yellow, orange and red areas. Yellow, orange and red areas –no piling activity during the period of 1 November to January 31 annually.\nPublic authorities should assess any mitigation measures added to a proposalafter project level assessments are undertaken. The mitigation should be appliedin alignment with International Council for the Exploration of the Sea advice.Public authorities should note that this advice has recently been revised fordredging acti vity. This allows public authorities to be flexible in applying mitigationand enables dredging to take place in areas that were previously closed. This isreflected in this policy and the mitigation advised above.\nPublic authorities should consider whether proposals located in figure 26 haveincluded herring spawning mitigation and the level of mitigation. If mitigation hasnot been considered justification of this is required.",

    "description": "Re-use of dredge material is about reducing the need to dispose of excavatedmaterial at marine disposal sites.\nDredged material can only be disposed in identified areas subject to the type ofdredged material. Where practical and if suitable, it can be re-used or recycledbefore disposing at sea.\nThe South Plan Analytical Report highlighted water quality, sediment loading andcoastal squeeze as an issue. Where practical, and particularly in estuarine areaswhere sediment loading is identified as an issue, dredged material can remain withinits sedimentary cell.\nRecent examples of re-use of marine dredge material include the saltmarshreplenishment works at Lymington and a capital dredging project in SouthamptonWater. Further information on these specific projects and dredging activity across thesouth marine plan areas can be found within the Marine management OrganisationMMO1073 report: use of beneficial dredge materials in the south inshore andoffshore marine plan areas.",
    "reason": "Re-use and natural dispersal of dredged material is important because it supportsthe growth of industry and increases available space within areas underdevelopment. It can also reduce the pressure on existing marine habitats with somematerials being able to support beneficial re-use and ecosystem services, forexample, replenishing mudflats providing habitat and feeding grounds for wildlife andrecharging of barrier beaches for coastal defence. This is particularly relevant inthe south marine plan areas due to the density of activities. For more information seethe South Plan Analytical Report.\nMarine licences may stipulate re-use as a condition. This is also signposted inaccordance with the Oslo/Paris Convention for the Protection of the MarineEnvironment of the North East Atlanti c guidance and the EU Waste FrameworkDirective.\nThe Marine Policy Statement (3.6.8) states that ‘applications to dispose of wastesmust demonstrate that appropriate consideration has been given to the internationallyagreed hierarchy of waste management options for sea disposal’.\nWhilst it is beneficial to re-use dredge materials, there are a number of challengesthat industry and beneficiaries face. The Marine Management OrganisationMMO1073 report: use of beneficial dredge materials in the south inshore and offshore marine plan areas, has gone some way to address these challenges, setting out the potential for the re-use of marine dredgings within the south marine plan areas.\nThe re-use of such dredgings is not straightforward or always feasible. It requiresfuture planning from all those involved from regulators and contractors to those thatmanage receipt of the dredged material. Constraints and scenarios regarding thisaction are also detailed within MMO1073 report.\nThis policy encourages the re-use of dredged material, whilst aiming to reduce thenumber of new disposal sites being created, along with existing sites currently being used.",
    "implementation": "This policy links to and supports policy S-BIO-3. It should be noted that mapshighlighting current re-use opportunities are not exhaustive, and only provideexamples of current areas of potential.\nProposals must highlight other areas for alternative use of dredged material insteadof using disposal sites. Such proposals should highlight where dredged material hasbeen identified as suitable to be re-used in an alternative way, and which area canaccommodate the matching dredged material in each instance.\nPublic authorities must establish whether the intent of this policy has been achievedthrough the application process.\nPublic authorities should note that harbour authorities’ statutory powers to dredgeand dispose of dredged materials in tidal waters are subject to consent. A licence todispose of dredged material at sea must be obtained from the Marine ManagementOrganisation. Information on exemption guidance and the licensing applicationprocess can also be found on their website.\nWhere The Crown Estate, or another party, own the bed of the harbour theirpermission for dredging operations is also likely to be needed. As of 2014165 allmaintenance and navigational dredging requires consent through a marine licenceunless it is specifically exempted166.\nThe South Marine Plan Habitats Regulations Assessment considered this policywould cause a material change to existing activities and may have a ‘likely significanteffect’ on relevant European and Ramsar sites. All new developments within thesouth marine plan area are legally required to undergo Habitats RegulationsAssessment.\nA project level appropriate assessment will also be required where the possibility ofa ‘likely significant effect’ on a European/Ramsar site cannot be excluded on thebasis of currently available information. A list of suggested mitigation measuresspecific to this policy that may be useful when considering any appropriateassessment are contained in table 21 within the South Marine Plan habitat andregulations assessment AAIR.",
